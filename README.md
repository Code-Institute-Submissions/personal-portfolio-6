Stream One Project: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute 

This is my personal portfolio website to share with prospective employers or clients my skills set and experience. The website structure was designed top from to bottom - left to right reading with the about section highligting a profile about myself, follow there is a skills section, work history section and contact form section.
The contact form gives the opportunity for direct communication, not far below in the footer there is a download CV link and social links for further information.

## UX
The project is targeting hiring managers with little time on their hands to scan throght and intere CV, hence the scroll down layout and sleek and clean design. The main focus is get the user to scan all the main infomation in one page and use the contact form to get in touch. 

## Strategy

1. My gaol is to have all the information in one page yet, separated by section within scroll down maner.
2. A fixed nav bar is avaliable to allow users to quick move between pages.
3. The design is clean and minimalist for an easy reading.

## Technologies

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Bootstrap 4
4. Google Fonts
5. TinyPNG - image compressor
6. PicMonkey - image resize
